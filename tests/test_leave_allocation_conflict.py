"""
Tests: Leave-Allocation Overlap Detection
==========================================
Policy: An employee on approved leave during a project period is STILL
eligible for allocation. Leave days are simply excluded from their working
availability in capacity calculations (handled by recommendation_service).
The check_leave_conflict() function detects overlaps and returns them as
informational warnings — it does NOT block the assignment.

What is tested (service layer — check_leave_conflict()):
  ● approved leave fully covering allocation → has_conflict=True (warning)
  ● approved leave partially overlapping (start) → has_conflict=True
  ● approved leave partially overlapping (end) → has_conflict=True
  ● single leave day inside allocation range → has_conflict=True
  ● leave date exactly equal to allocation start (boundary) → has_conflict=True
  ● leave date exactly equal to allocation end (boundary) → has_conflict=True
  ● allocation completely before leave → no conflict
  ● allocation completely after leave → no conflict
  ● pending leave overlapping → no conflict (only approved leaves matter)
  ● rejected leave overlapping → no conflict
  ● no leave at all → no conflict
  ● conflict result contains leave details for display
  ● no date range supplied → no conflict (check skipped)
