"""
Verification: intern paid-leave entitlement (1 paid leave/month, resets monthly)
================================================================================
Interns accrue PAID leave monthly: the first paid working-day in a calendar
month is PAID; further paid days that month are UNPAID; the allowance resets at
the start of each month. casual_sick / floater and ALL employee behaviour stay
on the existing annual-quota logic.

Tests the payroll classifier _classify_year_leaves(leaves, year, intern).
