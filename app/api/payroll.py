Payroll Calculation API
-----------------------
GET  /api/payroll/preview?month=YYYY-MM      — compute salary for all employees (no save)
POST /api/payroll/save                        — save / finalize a payroll run
GET  /api/payroll/saved?month=YYYY-MM        — retrieve a saved run with final numbers
PATCH /api/employees/{id}/salary             — update employee base salary

Pay (ground-truth salary records) — the source data the Monthly Pay calc derives from:
GET  /api/payroll/salaries                    — list employees with their base monthly salary
PUT  /api/payroll/salaries/{employee_id}      — set an employee's base monthly salary

All endpoints are admin-only (checked by role in request context via query param for now;
caller must pass current_user_id which maps to a user with role=admin).

    Apply the paid-leave entitlement to one employee's approved leaves for a calendar year.

    Walks leaves chronologically; each working day consumes its leave type's quota.
    Days within quota are PAID (no salary impact); days beyond it are UNPAID (deducted).
    A single leave may straddle the boundary (part paid, part unpaid).

    Entitlement differs by employee type:
      • Employees: annual quota per leave type (ANNUAL_LEAVE_QUOTA), consumed over the year.
      • Interns:   PAID leave accrues MONTHLY (INTERN_MONTHLY_PAID_QUOTA per calendar month,
                   resetting each month); casual_sick / floater keep the same annual quotas.

    `intern_until` preserves history across an intern→full-time promotion: when set,
    PAID days BEFORE that date use the monthly intern rule and days ON/AFTER it use the
    annual quota — so a promotion never retroactively reclassifies leave already taken.
