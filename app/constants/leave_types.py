# ── Annual paid-leave entitlement (per employee, per calendar year) ─────────
# Razorpay exposes no leave-balance API, so the entitlement is defined here and
# the remaining balance is computed locally as: quota − working-days already used
# (from approved leaves). A leave consumes its own type's balance; once a type's
# balance for the year is exhausted, further days of that type are treated as
# UNPAID leave (salary is deducted per working day).
#
# casual_sick is a single combined type in this system; 6 = 6 days total
# (not 6 casual + 6 sick). Adjust these numbers to change policy — no code edits
# elsewhere are required.
